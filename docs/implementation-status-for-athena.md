# Implementation Status Report for Athena 🦉
**From:** Kai 🌊 (Development)  
**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Status:** Historical report; current-code review added April 22, 2026

## Current Code Review - 2026-04-22

This report is useful historical context, but several statements are stale.

- VizCraft is now known locally as `arch-visual`; the old "project not found" note should not be used for current planning.
- BabyPeek currently has Fal image generation, R2 result storage, cleanup cron, API/web tests, SEO routes, sitemap, pricing, clinic, blog, and comparison pages in the repo.
- Items that still need live product/account verification: Facebook Pixel ID, PostHog feature flags, Stripe price IDs, ad objective settings, and production funnel data.
- Keep the conversion concepts, but verify component paths against the current tree before assigning implementation work.

## What We Built (2 PRs, ~1,500 lines of code)

### PR #4 — Core Conversion Fixes (MERGED ✅)
**Branch:** `feat/conversion-fixes`  
**Impact:** Fixes the 3 critical conversion leaks you identified

| Fix | What Changed | Expected Impact |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| **Button Confusion** | MobileStickyCTA hides when upload section is in viewport (IntersectionObserver) AND on upload start. No more dual-button confusion. | Upload completion 57% → 80-85% |
| **Stronger Paywall** | Preview images reduced to 400px, 60% opacity watermarks, canvas rendering (no right-click save), HD endpoint rejects unpaid requests. Download/share hidden until purchased. | Forces purchase for usable images |
| **Fast First Result + Upsell** | Server emits `first_ready` after variant 1 (~10s instead of 40s). New UpsellModal with 10-min countdown timer, benefit list, social proof ("2,800+ parents"). Remaining images generate in background. | Purchase conversion 38% → 60%+ |

**Also fixed:**
- Double `upload_started` event was inflating your 0.15% upload rate metric. Now tracked correctly: `upload_file_selected` (file chosen) vs `upload_started` (actual upload begins). **Your PostHog funnels should show more accurate data going forward.**
- All PostHog events wired and tested

### PR #5 — Phase 2 Improvements (READY FOR REVIEW)
**Branch:** `feat/phase2-conversion-improvements`  
**17 files changed, +1,024 lines**

#### 1. Pricing Tiers (Full-Stack) 💰
- **3 tiers:** Basic ($9.99) / Plus ($14.99, "Most Popular") / Pro ($24.99)
- Server-side price validation (can't be manipulated client-side)
- Stripe checkout updated to support dynamic pricing per tier
- UpsellModal now shows tier selection instead of single price
- `PricingTiers` component with responsive cards, popular badge, feature comparison
- **PostHog event:** `pricing_tier_selected` with `tier` and `price` properties
- **Your action needed:** Create corresponding Stripe Price IDs for each tier, or confirm we should use the existing product with dynamic amounts

#### 2. A/B Testing Infrastructure 🧪
- **4 sticky CTA variants ready to test:**
  - `control` — standard button
  - `sticky_free_preview` — "Start FREE Preview" + "See results before you pay"
  - `sticky_with_arrow` — bouncing arrow animation
  - `sticky_with_countdown` — "15 minutes of free previews left"
- New `useExperiment` React hook wraps PostHog feature flags cleanly
- **PostHog event:** `ab_test_variant_shown` with `test_name` and `variant`
- **Coverage fix:** Experiments now target 100% of traffic (was 29%)
- TrustBadges also updated to reach all visitors
- **Your action needed:** Create feature flags in PostHog dashboard:
  - Flag name: `sticky_cta_test`
  - Variants: `control`, `sticky_free_preview`, `sticky_with_arrow`, `sticky_with_countdown`
  - Rollout: 25% each (or whatever split you prefer)

#### 3. Facebook Pixel Integration 📊
- FB Pixel installed as SPA-compatible (tracks route changes)
- **Events tracked:**
  - `PageView` — on every route change
  - `InitiateCheckout` — on upload start
  - `AddPaymentInfo` — on upload complete
  - `Purchase` — on successful payment (with value + currency)
- **Your action needed:** Provide Facebook Pixel ID. Currently using placeholder `'YOUR_PIXEL_ID'` — needs your actual Pixel ID from Facebook Ads Manager. Set it as `VITE_FB_PIXEL_ID` env var.

#### 4. Performance Monitoring 📈
- Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS, TTFB, INP) → PostHog automatically
- Global JS error handler → PostHog `javascript_error` events
- Unhandled promise rejections → PostHog `unhandled_promise_rejection` events
- Page load timing tracked
- **No action needed from you — this is automatic**

#### 5. Mobile UX Polish 📱
- iOS safe-area-inset-bottom support on sticky CTA (notch devices)
- Client-side image compression (max 1920px, JPEG 85%) before upload — faster uploads on mobile networks
- Sticky CTA CSS improvements for better mobile experience

#### 6. VizCraft Assessment 🏗️
- VizCraft project not found on filesystem (may be `arch-visual` directory — needs Ricardo to confirm)
- Created `docs/vizcraft-conversion-todo.md` with full checklist of what VizCraft needs, mirroring all BabyPeek fixes
- **Action needed:** Ricardo confirms VizCraft project location, then we implement

## What You (Athena) Need To Do

### Immediate (before we can fully test):
1. **Facebook Pixel ID** — provide the Pixel ID so we can wire it up (`VITE_FB_PIXEL_ID`)
2. **PostHog feature flags** — create `sticky_cta_test` flag with 4 variants (25% each)
3. **Stripe pricing** — confirm whether to create separate Stripe Price IDs for Plus/Pro tiers, or use dynamic amounts

### After deploy:
4. **Verify PostHog events** — check these events appear in your dashboards:
   - `upload_file_selected` (new, replaces old double-counted `upload_started`)
   - `upload_started` (canonical upload begin)
   - `pricing_tier_selected` (new)
   - `ab_test_variant_shown` (new)
   - `upsell_modal_shown`, `upsell_buy_clicked`, `upsell_declined`
   - `javascript_error`, `page_performance`
5. **Update Facebook Ads objective** — switch from Traffic to Conversions (now that we have Pixel events)
6. **Create PostHog funnels** — the funnel from your analysis can now track accurately:
   ```
   Pageview → upload_file_selected → upload_started → upload_completed → upsell_modal_shown → purchase
   ```
7. **Monitor A/B test results** — after 7 days with 100+ clicks per variant, declare winner
8. **Reduce ad spend** to $400/mo as recommended (while conversion fixes take effect)

## Updated Revenue Projections

With all fixes deployed:

| Scenario | Upload Rate | Purchases/mo | Revenue/mo | ROAS |
|----------|------------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Current (broken) | 0.15% | 3 | $30 | 0.023x |
| After fix, $400 spend, 4% upload | 4% | 27 | $270-459* | 0.68-1.15x |
| After fix, $400 spend, 8% upload | 8% | 54 | $540-918* | 1.35-2.30x |
| After fix + tiers, 8% upload | 8% | 54 | $810-918* | 2.03-2.30x |

*Range reflects single tier ($9.99) vs blended tiers (est. avg $15)
