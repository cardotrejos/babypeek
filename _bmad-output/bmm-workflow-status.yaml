# User description captured during init
user_description: |
  Transform 4D ultrasound images into ultra-realistic in-utero photography using
  AI image generation models (Nano Banana Pro / GPT Image). Inspired by Linus 
  Ekenstam's viral approach using structured prompts with image-to-image editing.
