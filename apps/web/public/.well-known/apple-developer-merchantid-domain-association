# Apple Pay Domain Verification Placeholder
#
# This file is a PLACEHOLDER. Follow these steps to get the actual file:
#
# 1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Settings → Payment methods
# 2. Click "Configure" on Apple Pay
# 3. Add your production domain (e.g., 3d-ultra.com)
# 4. Download the verification file from Stripe
# 5. Replace THIS FILE with the downloaded file
# 6. Rename to: apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association (no extension)
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - The actual file has no extension (remove .txt)
# - It contains a long hex string from Apple/Stripe
# - It must be served at: https://yourdomain.com/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association
#
# For Stripe test mode, Apple Pay works without domain verification.
# Domain verification is required for production Apple Pay.
